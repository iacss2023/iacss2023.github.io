Authors are welcomed to proceed with the payment after the acceptance of the paper to be presented in the Conference. All accepted abstracts will be compiled in a Book of Abstracts, which will be sent to authors after the presentation in the Conference Parallel Sessions. However, some authors of accepted abstracts are invited to submit a short version (4 pages) to be considered for publication in our Conference-Proceedings, which will be a volume of the prestigious Springer Proceedings Series Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing. Thus, any authors interested in having their submission considered for publication as a short-paper in the Conference Proceedings are to select the option “Consideration for the Proceedings.” in the EasyChair platform during the abstract submission process. Authors are also invited to submit the full-version of their papers to the International Journal of Computer Science in Sport (IJCSS). The submission of full-version papers will undergo the normal submission, peer-review and free-access process, and fees must apply.</p><p class="note" data-v-195a8d4c>(Note: Only Accepted Abstracts will be considered for publication, after which you will be prompted to submit the short or full version of your paper).</p></div></div></div>',1),c=[s];function d(a,e,t,s,d,n){return(0,i.wg)(),(0,i.iD)("div",null,c)}var n={name:"SubmissionView"},o=t(89);const r=(0,o.Z)(n,[["render",d],["__scopeId","data-v-195a8d4c"]]);var l=r}}]);
