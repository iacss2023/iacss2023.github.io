This study, using examples from the top five European leagues and European competitions, introduces the concept and calculation formulas for soccer match efficiency, including offensive efficiency, defensive efficiency, and net efficiency. The results of this study indicate that net efficiency, within a certain range, can gauge the balance between a team's offensive and defensive efficiency and provide a better explanation for the phenomenon of 'dominating possession but failing to win.'\"\r\n          ]\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n          img: require('../../../assets/2024/speakers/Passfoto_witte.jpg'),\r\n          name: 'Prof. Dr. Kerstin Witte',\r\n          introduction: 'A Professor of Department of Sports Science at the Faculty of Human Sciences, Otto-von-Guericke-Universität Magdeburg.',\r\n          detail: [\r\n            \"Dr. Kerstin Witte's research interests include human movement sciences, sports equipment technology/sports technology, biomechanical modeling, performance diagnostics, and application for the following sports (running, karate, horse riding, swimming, rowing).\"],\r\n          abstractTitle: 'Sensor-based technique diagnostics in Olympic Hammer Throw and Shot Put for Athletes and Para-Athletes',\r\n          abstract: [\r\n            'Real-time feedback can be used to increase the efficiency of athletics throws training.

Quicker recovery has been associated with better cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF). Therefore, HRR can be regarded as a fitness indicator and may serve as a tool to monitor the performance potential of an athlete as well as to optimize the training schedule. To reliably measure HRR requires the athlete to enter a controlled laboratory setup with an ergometer or a treadmill. There is no standard or generally agreed upon protocol to measure HRR. One common approach is to measure the drop of heart rate during the first 30, 60, or 120 seconds following the cessation of maximal exercise load. However, such laboratory testing interrupts training schedules and may not always be available in practice. In this work, we propose ways to estimate HRR from data collected with power meters and heart rate sensors during field rides. This allows for continuous and automatic tracking of HRR without the burden of regular lab tests Our general approach is as follows. Given power and HR data we estimate linear and dynamical systems that serve as accurate mathematical models to predict the heart rate from power data. These models can also predict the decay of HR after a bout of maximal exercise intensity and thereby yield a way to estimate the HRR.The first model assumes a linear function that defines the HR equilibrium for given (constant) power demands. An ordinary differential equation (ODE) rules that the HR derivative is proportional to the difference of the HR equilibrium for the current power demand and the present HR. For constant power demands this model prescribes exponential solutions for the HR that asymptotically approach the corresponding equilibrium HR. The inverse constant of proportionality in the ODE can be interpreted as the time duration required for the HR to drop 63% towards the resting HR after a presumed constant exercise load. This time constant therefore can take up the role of HRR. The second model is a Wiener system, given by the sum of the convolution of the uniformly sampled power signal and the resting HR. The (one-sided) convolution kernel accounts for the accumulated influence of the past power demand on the current heart rate and also models the delayed effect of changes in power on the heart rate. Again, the 63% drop towards the resting HR after a constant exercise load can be read off the model; it is given by the 63rd percentile of the convolution kernel.',\r\n            'Our models are extended and improved versions of previously proposed models for HR prediction from power data. We discuss, validate, and compare the HR response and estimated HRR from the two models on a large dataset consisting of all recorded training and racing activities of three professional world class cyclists and three ambitious hobby riders collected over three consecutive years in about 4500 recorded rides.'\r\n          ]\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n          img: require('../../../assets/2024/speakers/yaping_zhong.jpg'),\r\n          name: 'Prof. Dr. Yaping Zhong',\r\n          introduction: 'A Professor in Sports Big-data Research Center at Wuhan Sports University, Wuhan, China.',\r\n          detail: [\r\n            \"Dr. Yaping Zhong's research interests include Intelligent Sports and data mining.\"],\r\n          abstractTitle: 'Frontier Progress in Promoting Health through Exercise Supported by AI'\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n          img: require('../../../assets/2024/speakers/tianbiao liu.jpg'),\r\n          name: 'A.P.

We examined 21,708 matches played in the top five leagues in Europe from the 2014/15 to 2019/20 season. Playing styles used by each team in each match was derived through a Gaussian-Mixture Model clustering of 31 match actions. The relationship between playing style choice and match outcome was also analysed using Multinomial Logistic Regression. However, team and opposition playing style predicted match outcome with low precision (39.78%). Flexibility, stability, and adaptability of playing styles were derived using the coefficient of unalikeability, and relationship with performance outcomes were computed using Pearson’s correlation. Playing style flexibility was positively correlated with both offensive and defensive performance outcomes and win frequency (p < .01). Conversely, teams displaying higher playing style stability conceded more shots in the penalty box but also demonstrated poorer offensive performance outcomes (p < .01). Playing style adaptability, indicative of high flexibility and stability, was positively associated with defensive performance outcomes and win frequency (p < .01). Our results indicate that high playing style variability, rather than mastering one specific style of play, may be a significant indicator of team performance. We therefore suggest that both flexibility and adaptability are key skills to develop during player development pathways.

This talk will present a joined project of Technical University Munich and the German Volleyball federation aiming to improve the anticipation of German national players in preparation of 2024 Olympics. The key idea of the project is to use video recordings of opponents and fade out the video short before the opponent player attacks the ball on the third contact. Players had to find visual cues which allow them to estimate the attacking technique (spike vs shot) and the direction (line vs. cross). In order to gain a deeper understanding of eye movements during anticipation per-formance in a defensive situation, an additional study of eye movements was carried out on national team players using eye tracking. Initial results show that national players clearly stand out from amateur players in terms of the prediction quality of defense-relevant ques-tions about the type and direction of an attacking shot. Furthermore, it was shown that the eye movements of top players and amateur players also differ, which may be a reason for their better anticipation skills.']\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n          img: require('../../../assets/2024/speakers/brice_guignard.jpg'),\r\n          name: 'Asst.
