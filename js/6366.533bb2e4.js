His habilitation in sports science is from Christian-Albrechts University, Kiel. Before his current position, he was a professor at the universities of Rostock and Augsburg.","His main research areas are game sports and talent development. His research activities in game sports focus on concepts and methods for practical support, e.g., for German national teams in handball, beach volleyball, para table tennis, and wheelchair rugby. Mathematical modelling of game sports using state-transition models, recurrence analysis or social network analysis plays a role as well. A recent field of interest is to find ways of dealing with the widely acknowledged nature of game sports as dynamic interaction processes with emergent behavior. Here, dynamical systems theory with synergetics and chaos comes into play, as well as empirical proof of chance effects and their impact on match and season results.","In addition to these practical and theoretical activities, there is a methodological interest in promoting methods in performance analysis. In earlier times, the design and validation of observational systems was dominant, but in the last two decades, methods of position detection came into reach. Actual topics here are the design of validation studies for the different technologies of position detection in sports and special problems such as comparability and gold standard development.","During the decades of his scientific activities, informatics became an increasingly valuable tool for supporting practical and theoretical performance analysis. This has led to the foundation of the scientific discipline of sports informatics. Martin Lames was involved in the foundation of IACSS, a scientific umbrella organization for interdisciplinary groups applying informatics in sports. He was member of the founding board, general secretary, from 2013 to 2022 president and is now one of the honorary presidents of IACSS.","He recently published a textbook “Performance Analysis in Game Sports – Concepts and Methods”. One of its main messages is that we mustn’t forget that the properties of game sports that cause troubles for scientists, e.g., emergence and unpredictability, are the reason why they are so attractive for spectators and media, i.e., why they exist."]},{img:i(8745),name:"Prof. Dr Sam Robertson",introduction:"Dr. Sam Robertson is a Professor at Victoria University and the host of the popular future of sport podcasts.",detail:["Sam Robertson is a researcher and consultant focusing on the future of sport.
