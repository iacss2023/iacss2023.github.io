Mathematical modelling of game sports using state-transition models, recurrence analysis or social network analysis plays a role as well. A recent field of interest is to find ways of dealing with the widely acknowledged nature of game sports as dynamic interaction processes with emergent behavior. Here, dynamical systems theory with synergetics and chaos comes into play, as well as empirical proof of chance effects and their impact on match and season results.',\r\n            'In addition to these practical and theoretical activities, there is a methodological interest in promoting methods in performance analysis.
