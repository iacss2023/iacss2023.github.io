The team has comprehensively promoted the cross-fertilization of disciplines, established an innovative ecosystem integrating disciplines, talents, and scientific research, and jointly enrolled more than 10 Ph.D. students in the direction of Sports Artificial Intelligence. The team has actively promoted international cooperation, planned sports science, and technology innovation with a global perspective, and jointly organized and participated in international academic exchanges and cooperation activities. Professor Hui Zhang holds the position of President of IACSS, the highest academic organization in the field of artificial intelligence in sports, and Professor Yingcai Wu has the director position.

With competitive sports as the primary research object, computational kinesiology deeply integrates computer science, technology, and kinesiology. It uses artificial intelligence, big data, human-computer interaction, visualization, and statistical analysis as the primary means to collect, manage, mine, analyze, and visualize competitive sports data and support in-depth applications such as simulation and prediction. Based on professional knowledge such as competitive sports science, explore the fundamental laws and complex connections between sports training, competitive ability, and competition performance, and improve athletes' scientific training level and competitive ability performance.
